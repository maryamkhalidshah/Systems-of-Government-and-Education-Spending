# Systems of Government and Education Spending

**Research Question**:  What democratic factors matter the most when it comes to predicting an increase in educational spending in UN member countries?

As of 2020, more than half of the worldâ€™s countries are democracies (of which 164 are UN member states). While there has been a lot of research on how education affects democratization, there has been comparatively little research devoted to understanding how democratic
institutions affect spending on education. Looking into the effect of specific democratic processes is important because no two democratic countries can be said to have exactly the
same democratic institutions, as they may vary on dimensions such as access to power, the
distribution of resources, and whether clean elections are held. Moreover, even if a few democratic countries are fairly similar in a few dimensions, the overall mix of democracy defining characteristics may be quite different.

**Background** <br>
Research supports that in general, greater educational spending improves student outcomes,
which in turn can affect employment rates, economic growth and scientific research in a
country. Therefore, understanding how democratic institutions affect education spending
is important in order to highlight factors that drive greater spending on education. This
is of even greater importance in less developed and developing democratic countries where
illiteracy and out of school children rates are high - what factor of their democratic processes is limiting their educational expenditure? Questions like these would be interesting
to answer because they would provide us insight into the link between democratic processes
and educational spending, whether certain predictors can be modified to improve educational spending in a country, and why there are differences in educational spending across
democratic countries.

**Data Sources**
1. **Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) data**: The V-Dem is a multidimensional and
disaggregated dataset that is a new approach to conceptualizing democracy. This
dataset was used to obtain data on democratic processes and institutions.

2. **World Bank data on government expenditure on education, total (% of
GDP)**: The World Bank data, considered to be the most comprehensive and reliable source of developmental and economic metrics, was used to obtain data about
educational spending in countries across the 15 years being considered.
